                   <h3>Here's a timeline of Dr. Borlaug's life</h3>

                   <li><strong>1938 </strong> Marries wife of 69 years Magaret Gibson. Gets laid off due to    budget cuts. Inspired by Elvin Charles Stakeman, he returns to school study under Stakman,    who teaches him abour breeding pest-resistent plants.</li>
                   <li><strong>1941</strong> - Tries to enroll in the military after the pearl Habor attack.    but is rejected. Instead, the military asked his lab to work on waterproof glue </li>

                   <li><strong>1944</strong> - Rejects a 100% salary increases from Dupant, leaves behind his    pregnant wife, and flies to Mexico to head a new plant pathology program. Over the next 16    years , his team breeds 6,000 different strains of disease resistant wheat - including    different varieties for each major climate on Earth.</li>
                   <li><strong>1945</strong> - Discovers a way to grown whear twice each season, doubling    wheat yields.</li>
                   <li><strong>1953</strong> - crosses a short, sturdy dwarf breed of wheat with a    high-yielding American breed, creating a strain tht responds well to fertilizer . It goes    on to provide 95% of Mexico wheat.</li>
                   <li><strong>1962</strong> - Visits Delhi and brings his high-yielding stains of wheat to    the Indian subcontinent in time to help mitigate mass starvation due to a rapidly    expanding population</li>

                   <li><strong>2005</strong> - sates "we will have to double the world food supply by 2050."    Argues that genetically modified crops are the only way we can meet the deman, as we run    out of arable land. Says that GM crops are not inherently dangerous because "we've been    genetically modifying plansts and animals for a long time. Long before we called it     science, people were selecting the best breeds."</li> 
                  <li><strong>2009</strong> - dies at the age of 95. </li>
                  </li>
